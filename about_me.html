            <h2>Upbringing</h2>
            <p> A little about myself: I was born in Brooklyn, New York. At 11 months old, I was taken to China to be
                raised
                by
                my grandparents, returning to America at the age of 5. I didn’t know any English at that time. It was
                challenging to be different from others, but I conquered that path, and shaped myself to who I am today.
                I
                have
                an older brother who’s three years my senior, and a Shiba Inu named Max. My parents own a restaurant
                near
                downtown Dayton, Ohio.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy working out and playing video games. My passion for video games sparked my
                interest
                in
                pursuing a tech-related career. This interest led me to join the Information Technology Career Tech
                Program
                in
                high school, where I was introduced to the worlds of software and hardware. The software side of IT
                especially
                piqued my interest, and that's now the major I am working towards, Computer Science.</p>

            <h2>Mindset</h2>
            <p>Even though I know the IT field is oversaturated, I’m determined to make my mark in it. I have a record
                of
                excellent attendance and a strong work ethic. My parents worked tirelessly, day and night, hoping that
                my
                brother and I would succeed in life. Their sacrifices fuel my determination to achieve success.</p>
